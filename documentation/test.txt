- unitary tests:
 * unitary tests by functions
 	=> test an existing specific function in each testing function
	=> wide range of input data
	esp. limit cases
	=> recreate partially the existing structure in order to test each 
	function
 * unitary tests by functionality
 	=> test a specific functionality in each testing function

- global tests:
	=> test the behaviour of the whole programme considering given input 
	data
	=> increment on test difficulty: from basic behaviour to specific cases
